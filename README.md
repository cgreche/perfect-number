This is a Perfect Number Tester/Finder test project.

It is composed by 3 modules:
- perfect-number: The base component for testing and finding perfect numbers;
- perfect-number-http-sb-swagger: A web-based API for interacting with the perfect-number component. This is made using Spring Boot and Swagger;
- perfect-number-http-java: A web-based API and user interface for interacting with the perfect-number component. This is made using only pure Java, HTML and Javascript.

Hot to run:
- Build perfect-number-http-sb-swagger or perfect-number-http-java projects using Maven;
- Run them;
- Access them:
  - For perfect-number-http-sb-swagger: access the Swagger UI at http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html;
  - For perfect-number-http-java: access localhost:8080.
 
That's it for now.
